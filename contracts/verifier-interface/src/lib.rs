#![no_std]

//! Published cross-contract interface for `contracts/verifier`.
//!
//! Another Soroban contract that wants to call `verify_proof` on a deployed
//! `contracts/verifier` instance can depend on this crate instead of
//! reimplementing the XDR invocation by hand:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use zksoroban_verifier_interface::VerifierClient;
//!
//! let client = VerifierClient::new(&env, &verifier_contract_id);
//! let verified: bool = client.verify_proof(
//!     &caller, &proof_a, &proof_b, &proof_c, &public_inputs,
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! See `docs/architecture.md`'s "Cross-Contract Interface" section and
//! `contracts/examples/proof-gate` for a full worked example.
