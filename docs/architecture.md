# Architecture

`zksoroban` is split into four layers:

- `circuits/`: the zk statement definition
- `sdk/`: the client bridge from `circom` / `snarkjs` output into Soroban calldata
- `contracts/`: the on-chain verifier
- `demo/`: the end-to-end proof generation and verification flow

## Reference Statement

The reference circuit proves knowledge of a private `secret` such that:

```text
Poseidon(secret) == commitment
```

Inputs:

- private: `secret`
- public: `commitment`

The circuit lives in [circuit.circom](/home/amuda/sorobanzk/circuits/poseidon_preimage/circuit.circom).

## Data Flow

```text
secret
  |
  v
Poseidon hash off-chain
  |
  v
commitment
  |
  v
circom + snarkjs
generate Groth16 proof
  |
  v
SDK formatProof()
encodes proofA / proofB / proofC / publicInputs
  |
  v
SDK verifyOnChain()
submits Soroban transaction
  |
  v
Verifier contract
reconstructs vk_x and runs pairing check
  |
  v
bool result
```

## Circuit Layer

The circuit is intentionally minimal. It demonstrates the complete zk integration path on Stellar without introducing application-specific logic like nullifiers, Merkle proofs, or registries.

Artifacts:

- `circuit.circom`
- `input_example.json`
- `setup/circuit.zkey`
- `setup/verification_key.json`

The setup artifacts are testnet-only and tied to this exact circuit. If the circuit changes, the proving key, verification key, proof vectors, and contract constants must all change with it.

## SDK Layer

The SDK has three responsibilities:

- `poseidon.ts`: compute the same Poseidon hash used by the reference circuit
- `proof.ts`: convert `snarkjs` proof JSON into the exact BN254 byte layout expected by the contract
- `verify.ts`: build, submit, and decode the Soroban verifier transaction

Public API:

- `poseidon(inputs: bigint[]): bigint`
- `formatProof(proof, publicSignals): SorobanProofCalldata`
- `formatVerifyingKey(vk): RegistryVerifyingKey`
- `verifyOnChain(opts): Promise<VerifyResult>` — `contracts/verifier`, signed transaction
- `verifyViaRegistry(opts): Promise<boolean>` — `contracts/registry`, simulation-only
- `verifyBatchOnChain(opts): Promise<VerifyBatchResult>` — `contracts/verifier`, batched, signed transaction
- `verifyBatchViaRegistry(opts): Promise<boolean[]>` — `contracts/registry`, batched, simulation-only
- `estimateVerifyFee(opts): Promise<EstimateVerifyFeeResult>`
- `getContractConfig(opts): Promise<ContractConfig>`

See [Batch Verification](#batch-verification) below for the two batch functions.

The SDK is stateless. RPC URL, contract ID, and source keypair are passed in at call time.

## Contract Layer

The Soroban verifier contract stores no proofs or nullifiers, but it is
no longer fully stateless: it holds an admin address, per-caller
rate-limit state (see Auth Model below), and — as of the storage-backed
verifying key — the verifying key itself.

The contract:

1. requires the caller's own Soroban auth
2. enforces a per-caller, per-window rate limit
3. parses `proof_a`, `proof_b`, `proof_c`
4. parses the public input field element and the `expiry_ledger` field,
   rejecting proofs whose expiry has already passed
5. reads the currently-stored verifying key and reconstructs
   `vk_x = IC[0] + IC[1] * public_input`
6. runs the Groth16 BN254 pairing equation
7. returns `true` or `false`

The verifying key is set at construction time (`__constructor` takes a
`VerifyingKey` argument alongside `admin`) and can be replaced later via
`update_vk`, which requires the stored admin's auth and validates the
new key's `ic` length matches what this circuit's public-input count
expects. This means a circuit's verifying key can now be rotated without
a full contract redeploy — the original motivation for this design (see
[zksoroban#9](https://github.com/yusufadeagbo/zksoroban/issues/9)) — at
the cost of a real trust-model change: see
[`docs/security-model.md`](security-model.md)'s Trust Assumptions for
what a compromised admin key can now do that it couldn't before.

Current Testnet deployment:
`CBL6MAWJALQP25LYKUUOC34K464XPSF6BLKUW6MXZDEXEDXMQUSP7HNN`

### Auth Model

`verify_proof` calls `caller.require_auth()` unconditionally — every
call must be authorized by the address passed as `caller`, not merely
submitted by it. This means:

- An attacker cannot attribute rate-limit usage, or a successful
  verification, to an address that did not itself sign off on this
  specific invocation.
- Authorization is separate from *who pays for and submits* the
  transaction — Soroban's auth framework is meta-transaction friendly,
  so a relayer can submit on a caller's behalf as long as the caller
  supplied a valid auth entry.

`set_limits` similarly requires the *stored* admin address's auth,
looked up from contract storage — not whatever address happens to be
passed as an argument.

There is no allowlist/permission-tiering above this: any address that
can produce a valid Soroban auth entry for itself can call
`verify_proof`, subject only to the rate limit. See
[`docs/security.md`](security.md) for the full threat checklist this
auth model was evaluated against, and
[`docs/security-model.md`](security-model.md) for the full-stack
security model (guarantees, trust assumptions, and threat model)
that application developers building on `zksoroban` should read before
relying on any of this.

### Rate-Limit Storage

`Admin` and `Limits` live in `env.storage().instance()` — small,
rarely-changing config that should always be loaded with the contract.
Per-caller `CallCount(Address, u32)` entries live in
`env.storage().temporary()` instead, with `extend_ttl` called on every
write so an entry survives at least the rest of its own rate-limit
window before the ledger evicts it. This keeps instance storage from
growing by one entry per `(caller, window)` pair for the contract's
entire lifetime (see [`docs/security.md`](security.md) finding #6).

Migrating an already-deployed contract instance to this scheme does
not retroactively clean up anything: a code upgrade replaces the
contract's logic, not its existing storage, so any `CallCount` entries
an older deployment already wrote under `instance()` stay there,
unread and unused by the new code, until that instance is redeployed
from scratch.

### Verification-Count Storage

`VerificationCount(BytesN<32>)` tracks how many times `verify_proof`/
`verify_batch` has *successfully* verified a proof for a given
public-input commitment (the same sha256 hash published as `inputs_hash`
in `VerificationResult`), for off-chain analytics and abuse detection —
queryable via `verification_count`.

This uses `env.storage().instance()` with a `u64` counter, per issue
#41's specification. Unlike `CallCount` (finding #6), the commitment is
derived from the proof's public inputs which the circuit author controls,
so an attacker cannot mint unbounded distinct commitments to grow
storage. The counter increments only on a successful pairing check —
failed proof attempts do not affect the count. The admin can call
`upgrade` to redeploy from scratch if storage ever becomes a concern.

## Events

Both `contracts/verifier::verify_proof` and `contracts/registry::verify_proof`
publish a `verification_result` event on the outcome paths that return via
`Ok(...)` — see [zksoroban#10](https://github.com/yusufadeagbo/zksoroban/issues/10).

Topics: `["zk", "verify"]` (fixed, via `#[contractevent(topics = ["zk", "verify"])]`).

Data (a map, one entry per field):

| Field         | Type         | Verifier | Registry |
|---------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| `success`     | `bool`       | yes      | yes      |
| `caller`      | `Address`    | yes      | no — registry's `verify_proof(id, ...)` takes no caller/auth argument |
| `inputs_hash` | `BytesN<32>` | yes      | yes      |

`inputs_hash` is **sha256** of the concatenated `public_inputs` bytes, in
call order — not Poseidon. Poseidon is not available as a host primitive
in this Soroban SDK version (only `sha256`/`keccak256` and the BN254/BLS12-381
pairing operations are); the only existing Poseidon implementation in this
repo (`sdk/src/poseidon.ts`) is a variable-arity implementation whose round
constants are loaded at runtime from `circomlibjs`'s JS data tables, with no
practical `no_std` Rust port. Since this hash only feeds off-chain indexers
and monitoring — it is never re-consumed by a circuit or checked
in-contract — Poseidon's SNARK-friendliness has no benefit here, so sha256
was used instead.

### Why the allowlist/rate-limit/expiry rejections in `contracts/verifier` don't emit an event

Soroban rolls back **all** events published during a contract call whose
top-level return is `Err(code)` from a `#[contracterror]`-typed `Result`
(confirmed empirically against this repo's `soroban-sdk` version — the
WASM ABI encodes a contract-level `Err` return as a failed invocation, and
the host rolls back both storage and events to the state the call started
with). `verify_proof` still returns `Err(Error::CallerNotAllowed)`,
`Err(Error::RateLimitExceeded)`, and `Err(Error::ProofExpired)` for those
three rejections, exactly as before this event was added — so publishing on
those paths would be dead code; the event would never actually reach an
indexer.

Those three cases don't need the event to be observable, though: a failed
`verify_proof` transaction already carries its specific `Error` variant
(decoded by the SDK's typed-error mapping — see #184), which is at least as
informative as this event's bare `success: bool` would have been. The event
only adds real value on the paths that were genuinely silent before it
existed and still return `Ok(...)`: wrong public input count, a malformed
`expiry_ledger` encoding, and the pairing-check result itself. Those are
the only three paths `contracts/verifier::verify_proof` publishes on.

`contracts/registry::verify_proof` was never affected by this — it always
returned a bare `bool`, never `Result`, so every one of its outcomes
(unknown circuit ID, wrong input count, pairing result) publishes the
event.

## Demo Layer

The demo script proves the full stack works on Testnet:

1. generate a fresh random secret
2. compute its Poseidon commitment
3. generate a Groth16 proof with `snarkjs`
4. format the proof through the SDK
5. invoke the Soroban verifier
6. print the transaction hash and verification result

This is the strongest practical test in the repo because it exercises:

- the circuit
- the setup artifacts
- the SDK encoding
- Soroban transaction submission
- the deployed verifier contract

## Verifying Key Registry

The single-circuit verifier hardcodes one verifying key. The registry contract in `contracts/registry/` generalizes this so multiple circuits can be supported without redeploying.

The registry stores a verifying key per circuit ID and dispatches verification to the matching key:

```text
register_circuit(id, vk)         verify_proof(id, proof, public_inputs)
        |                                   |
        v                                   v
  admin.require_auth()              lookup vk by circuit id
        |                                   |
        v                          +--------+--------+
  store vk under                   |                 |
  Circuit(id)                  found vk         unknown id
        |                          |                 |
        v                          v                 v
  persistent storage      reconstruct vk_x      return false
                          + BN254 pairing        (no panic)
                                   |
                                   v
                            bool result
```

Key properties:

- `register_circuit(id, vk)` is gated by the admin address configured at construction.
- `verify_proof(id, ...)` returns `false` for unknown circuit IDs instead of panicking.
- The verifying key is variable-length: it carries `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`, `delta`, and an `ic` vector whose length is one greater than the circuit's public input count.

### Testnet Deployment

The registry is deployed and live on Stellar Testnet:

- Contract address: `CDTPNARKKZCZ36PL4BNKBXZTT2BLVR373S2K5NCFAOKCPPY62ESRHSXH`
- `poseidon_preimage` is registered under circuit ID `1`, using the same
  verifying key as `contracts/verifier`'s hardcoded constants (encoded
  identically — verified byte-for-byte against
  `contracts/registry/src/tests.rs`'s known-correct test constants
  before registering).
- Verified against real, previously-proven-valid proof bytes (the same
  ones `sdk/test/fixtures.ts` uses): a correct proof returns `true`, and
  a deliberately tampered proof (negated `proof_a` y-coordinate) returns
  `false`. Both checked directly on-chain via `stellar contract invoke`,
  not simulated.

**What is not yet done**: `merkle_inclusion`, `range_proof`, and
`threshold_2of3` are registered with the registry and verified end to
end in a local test environment (`contracts/registry/src/tests.rs`),
but not yet registered on the *live* Testnet deployment — that
`register_circuit` call needs the registry's admin key, which is a
maintainer action, not something a contributor's PR can do on its own.
See docs/multi-circuit.md for the full pattern. `demo/` itself now
targets the live registry (circuit ID `1`, `poseidon_preimage`) via
`sdk/src/verify.ts`'s `verifyViaRegistry`, and `contracts/verifier`'s
own `verify_proof(caller, ...)` signature is what `verifyOnChain`
speaks.

## Batch Verification

Both contracts have a `verify_batch` entry point alongside `verify_proof`,
so an application that needs to check many proofs pays one transaction's
overhead instead of one per proof — see
[zksoroban#13](https://github.com/yusufadeagbo/zksoroban/issues/13).

### `contracts/verifier::verify_batch`

```rust
verify_batch(caller: Address, proofs: Vec<ProofItem>) -> Result<Vec<bool>, Error>
```

One caller, many proofs — `caller.require_auth()` happens once for the
whole batch, not once per item. Each `ProofItem` (`proof_a`, `proof_b`,
`proof_c`, `public_inputs` — the same fields `verify_proof` takes, minus
`caller`) is still run through the *exact* allowlist/rate-limit/expiry/
pairing logic `verify_proof` uses (both now call a shared internal
`verify_one`), in order, against the same rate-limit counter — so an
earlier proof in the batch consuming budget can cause a later one in the
*same* batch to come back `false` for exceeding the limit.

The one behavior batch deliberately does **not** share with
`verify_proof`: a per-item allowlist/rate-limit/expiry rejection never
fails the call. `verify_batch` only returns `Err(...)` for
`Error::NotInitialized` — a genuinely batch-invalidating condition (the
contract itself isn't set up) — never for an individual bad proof, which
just becomes `false` in the result vec. This is why batch can also do
something `verify_proof` can't: publish a `verification_result` event for
*every* item, rejected or not. `verify_proof`'s own event is deliberately
skipped on its `Err(...)` paths (see [Events](#events) above) because
that `Err` rolls back the whole call, making publishing there a silent
no-op — but a per-item rejection inside `verify_batch` never rolls back
the batch call itself, so its event survives, unlike a standalone
`verify_proof` call for the same rejected proof would.

### `contracts/registry::verify_batch`

```rust
verify_batch(batch: Vec<BatchItem>) -> Vec<bool>
```

Each `BatchItem` adds a `circuit_id: u32` field on top of the same proof
fields, so one call can batch proofs against *different* circuits —
the main reason batching is more valuable against the registry than the
single-circuit verifier (see the issue's scoping note). No auth, no
`Result` — same as `verify_proof(id, ...)`, every outcome (including an
unknown circuit ID) is just `true`/`false`, and every item gets its own
event unconditionally, with no `Err`-rollback subtlety to work around at
all.

### SDK

- `verifyBatchOnChain(opts): Promise<VerifyBatchResult>` — targets
  `contracts/verifier`, mirrors `verifyOnChain`: requires a `keypair`
  (real auth, real rate-limit mutation) and submits one signed
  transaction.
- `verifyBatchViaRegistry(opts): Promise<boolean[]>` — targets
  `contracts/registry`, mirrors `verifyViaRegistry`: no `keypair`,
  simulation-only, since the registry's `verify_batch` requires no auth
  and mutates no storage.

Both encode their `items` array as a single `Vec<ProofItem>` /
`Vec<BatchItem>` contract argument — one Soroban operation, one
transaction, regardless of batch size. Each item is a `#[contracttype]
struct`, which Soroban encodes as a Map keyed by `Symbol`, not `String` —
the SDK builds these with `nativeToScVal`'s per-field `'symbol'` key-type
hint rather than its object default (which produces `String` keys and
would fail to decode on the contract side).

### Demo

`demo/src/batchVerify.ts` is a non-interactive integration script:
it batch-verifies 3 real proofs — loaded directly from
`circuits/{range_proof,threshold_2of3,merkle_inclusion}/fixtures/
{proof,public}.json`, no `circom` toolchain needed — across those 3
circuit IDs, in one `verifyBatchViaRegistry` call. Run against the live
Testnet registry (this script's default), every result comes back `false`
today, for the same reason noted above: only `poseidon_preimage` is
registered there. Pointed at a registry instance that has the other three
circuits registered (`SOROBAN_TEST_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID`), it asserts
every result is `true` instead.

## Admin Ownership & Contract Upgrades

Both `contracts/verifier` and `contracts/registry` share the same
two-step admin transfer and self-upgrade mechanism — see
[zksoroban#12](https://github.com/yusufadeagbo/zksoroban/issues/12).

### Two-step admin transfer

Rotating the admin address is a two-call handshake, not a single
"set new admin" call, so a mistyped or unreachable address can never
strand the contract without a working admin:

1. `propose_admin(new_admin)` — requires the **current** admin's auth.
   Stores `new_admin` as pending; the current admin is unchanged until
   step 2 completes.
2. `accept_admin()` — requires the **pending** admin's own auth, not the
   current admin's. Promotes the pending admin to admin and clears the
   pending slot.

`pending_admin()` is a read-only getter for whatever is currently
proposed (`None` if nothing is pending). Calling `accept_admin` with
nothing pending fails — `Err(Error::NoPendingAdmin)` on
`contracts/verifier`, a panic on `contracts/registry` (matching that
contract's existing panic-based error handling; it has no
`#[contracterror]` type today).

`propose_admin` and `accept_admin` never touch the contract's wasm or any
other state — they only ever change who the admin address is.

### Upgrade

`upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` — requires the current admin's auth — calls
`env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)`, replacing
the contract's executable in place. The contract's address and storage
are untouched; only the code behind them changes. The new wasm must
already be uploaded to the network
(`env.deployer().upload_contract_wasm`) before calling `upgrade` — the
host rejects a hash that isn't already-uploaded code. The swap doesn't
take effect until the current invocation finishes, so a contract can't
upgrade itself mid-call and then keep running as the new code.

### Out of scope (per #12)

No timelock on either the handoff or the upgrade, no governance/voting,
and no proxy pattern — both contracts upgrade their own executable in
place rather than sitting behind a separate, swappable proxy address. A
compromised admin key can immediately upgrade either contract to
arbitrary code, and can propose an ownership handoff (though not force
one through — `accept_admin` still needs the *recipient's* own auth).
See [`docs/security-model.md`](security-model.md)'s Trust Assumptions for
what a compromised admin key can do.

## Design Choices

Why the verifier keeps its state minimal (admin + rate-limit counters,
nothing proof- or nullifier-related):

- simpler to audit
- cheaper to invoke
- enough for an MVP reference implementation

Why the verifying key is storage-backed rather than hardcoded:

- a circuit's key can be rotated (new trusted setup, fixed a bug in the
  original ceremony, etc.) without a full contract redeploy, which
  would otherwise break every existing integration's contract address
- this is still a single-circuit verifier — `ic` length is validated
  against this circuit's fixed public-input count, not made fully
  generic; `contracts/registry` is the separate contract for genuinely
  multi-circuit support

Why Groth16:

- proofs are compact
- verification is efficient
- the Soroban BN254 host support makes it practical on-chain

## Non-Goals for This MVP

Out of scope for the current architecture:

- nullifier tracking
- multi-circuit verifier registries
- privacy-preserving application logic
- production trusted setup ceremonies
- wallet UX

Those are downstream systems that can be built on top of this foundation.
